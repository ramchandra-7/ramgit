for every user to run aws
used which aws in ec2-user
/usr/local/bin/aws
anfd echo $PATH
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-223 bin]$ echo $PATH
/home/ec2-user/.local/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin

in ram user
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

but this is temporary.when session is over its gone

to configure
awscli configure --profile <profilename>

while running commands use it along with command
aws <command> --profile <profiename>

aws ec2 describe-instances --profile user1

its not good to use aaws configure because anyone who has access to instance can get those creds
its better to use instance roles ,attch an role to ec2
