load balancing to multiple https apps across machines(target grps)

load balancing to multiple apps across same  machines(containers)

routing based on different target grps
based on url ex:expample.com/users and example.com/posts
based on hostname in url :one.example.com  and two.exapmple .com

great fit for micro services and container based application

gives fixed hostname:
app servers doesnt see ip of client directly:
true ip is inserted in header-x-forwaded-for
can also get port and protocol used 

client ip is directly talking to lb ,when lb talks to ec2 ,it used lb private ip


The nodes of an Internet-facing load balancer have public IP addresses.
The DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer is publicly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes.
Therefore, Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the Internet.

The nodes of an internal load balancer have only private IP addresses. 
The DNS name of an internal load balancer is publicly resolvable to the private IP addresses of the nodes. 
Therefore, internal load balancers can only route requests from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer.

we can route the requests using path by editing target grps and writing rule to send the request to particular path to particaula instance and give specific input
