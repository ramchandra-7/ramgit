in memory databases with realy high performance 
help reduce load of dtaabases for read intensive workload

elastic cache is placed betweeen rds and  application.

app queries elastic cache ,ifnot available get from rds and store in elastic cache
helps relieve load in rds

when user logs in,app writes session data into elastic cache
when user hits another session,intance retrieves session and user is already logged in
