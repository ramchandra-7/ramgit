scalability:
that an app can handle greater loads by adapating:
1.vertical scaling,horizontal scaling
vertical scaling:increasing size of instance(upgrading instance)
2.hor scaling:increasing number of systems for our app(scale in/out)

high availabilty:
means running an app in atleast 2 data centres/azs
goal is to survive data centre loss
