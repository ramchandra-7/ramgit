we create an instance by enabling pub ip,in pub subnet.
we keep ssh as only my ip in security grp and name that sg
we login to it and create keypair usin ssh-keygen
we copy his and import that keypair in aws 
now we launch bh in prv subnet and disable pub ip

add sg as previous instance sg
add http port as all traffic
use http_kp to launch it
install httpd and check in browser using pubip:80
