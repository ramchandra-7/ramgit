servers that forward traffic to multiple servers downstreams

why?
we just need to know dns of lb.not the instances behind it
spread across multiple instances.
regular health check of instances
provdes ssl for websites

helath cjeck is done on a route and port
if response is not 200,then instance is unhelathy

3 types:
classic lb
http,https,tcp
app load balancer
http,https,websocket
nw load balancer
tcp,tls,udp


we can set up either public(external) or private(internal) loadbalancer

4xx are client induced errors
5xx are app induced errors
lb 503 errror means capacity at target or no registered target
if lb cant connect to app,check sg
