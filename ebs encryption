when we create encrpyted ebs vol:
data at rest is encrpyted inside vol
all data in flight is encrpyted nw instance and vol is encrpyed
all smapshots are encrpyted
all vols created from snapshots
encrpytion and decrypttion are handled transparently(we dont need to manage)
ebs encryption leverages keys from aes-256

to encpyrt an unencrpyteed ebxs vol:
create ebs ss of vol
take ebs ss(using copy)
by default ss is unencryted
now got to snapshots and slelect create snapshot by enabling encrpyting ss

cretae new ebs from ss
attach ebs vol to original instancce


we can also cretae encrpyted ss using  kms key
