it is aglobal service,but we need to select a region while creating bucket

versioining is enabled at bucket level
for versioning the different versions we upload shud have same name

encrpytio:
sse-s3:    encrpts s3 objects using keys handled &managed by aws 

object is server side encrpted
aes-256 encyption 
while uploading object ,we provide a https+header ,after finding this header,aws uses its own s3 managed key and encrpts objects and stores in s3 bucket
header="x-amzserver-side-encyrtion":"aes-256"



sse-kms  levergaes aws kms to manage encrpytion keys

while uploading object ,we provide a https+header ,after finding this header,aws uses its kms cmk (customer  managed key )and encrpts objects and stores in s3 bucket
header "x-amzserver-side-encyrtion":"aws:kms"

sse-c-    when we wnat to mange our own keys

sse using data keys fully managed by customer outside aws
s3 doesnt store encrption key we provide
https is used:
encrption ke must be provided in http headers,for every http request made
along with object ,e provide a cient side data key,aws encrpyts using this data key
even to retrieve we need this data key
client side encryption-
we encrytpt the objects before uploading to aws s3,we decrytpt while retreiving
customer fully manages keys and encrption cycle

we can enable encrption for whole bucket or while uploading individual objects
