on aws side, we have a vpn gw and on corporate side we have customer gw

by site to site vpn,we connect aws nw to corporate nw 
seems like both are in same nw(corporate)

bw customer gw and vpn gw we set up s-s vpn

it links the corporate and aws nw together

s-svpn
vpg:
acts as vpn concentrstor on the aws side of vpn connection
vgw is created and attahed to vpc from which u want to create s-s vpn

cg:
