has internet connectivity and all instances have pub ip

we can add more than 1 cidr to vpc

subnets are tried to az

we place load balanceers in pub sn
internet gateway helps instances in vpc connnect to internet,scales horizontally is ha and redundant
ig is alos nat for instances that jave public ipv4

ig alone doesnt give internet,route tables need to be edited 


created in specific az,uses eip
cant be used by insatnces in same subnet ,only other subnets
private sn will talk to nat,nat talks ti igw
nat gateway place in pub sn
private rt will have entry for nat gw


if we select enable dns hostname setting for vpc,it also gives public dns names along eith pub ip for instances

create a private hosted zone (create any domain and access within vpc)


nacl is per subnet
